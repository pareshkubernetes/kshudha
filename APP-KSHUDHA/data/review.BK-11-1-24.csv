Saurabh Srivastava;We ordered Pav bhaji, vada pav, and dabheli for around 25 people. I was looking to order these specific items and accidentally came across this website. The limited menu somehow pursuaded me to order from Kshudha. My assumption was that with such a limited menu, they must be experts. Oh boy! My assumption was spot on. The food was phenomenal. I can bet that no restaurant in DFW area can match the quality and freshness of the food. Each and every guest praised the food and overate. We could smell the fresh ingredients right off the packaging. The owners are so honest about their competency. I asked if they can make tava pulao, which was honestly denied. I highly recommend Kshudha to everyone who loves freshly prepared pav bhaji, vada pav, and dabheli. I will definitely be ordering again. I wish we had more caterers like Kshuda in the DFW area. ;5;2024-10-29;

Fenil Patel;I ordered Samosa, Vada Pav, Dabeli, and Bhaji Pav for 40 people, and every bite was a true taste of India! Kshudha's food was unbelievably flavorful, with freshly made masalas that brought authenticity to every dish. If you’re craving real Indian street food in Irving, I highly recommend Kshudha – they deliver on every promise.;5;2024-10-26;
Raju Parmar;"Kshudha Catering exceeded my expectations! I recently ordered Dabeli and Bhaji Pav for an event with around 60 guests, and everyone was raving about the delicious, authentic flavors. The attention to detail in each dish truly shone through, and it felt like a taste of India brought right to our gathering. Every guest enjoyed the food so much that they asked for Kshudha's contact information, eager to bring this unforgettable taste to their own events. The only note I had was my personal preference for red onions with Bhaji Pav instead of the provided yellow onions, but that small detail did nothing to overshadow the incredible experience. I’m thrilled to recommend Kshudha Catering to anyone looking for top-notch, flavorful, and heartwarming Indian cuisine. They truly know how to impress!";4.5;2024-10-25;
