Saurabh Srivastava,We ordered Pav bhaji, vada pav, and dabheli for around 25 people. I was looking to order these specific items and accidentally came across this website. The limited menu somehow pursuaded me to order from Kshudha. My assumption was that with such a limited menu, they must be experts. Oh boy! My assumption was spot on. The food was phenomenal. I can bet that no restaurant in DFW area can match the quality and freshness of the food. Each and every guest praised the food and overate. We could smell the fresh ingredients right off the packaging. The owners are so honest about their competency. I asked if they can make tava pulao, which was honestly denied. I highly recommend Kshudha to everyone who loves freshly prepared pav bhaji, vada pav, and dabheli. I will definitely be ordering again. I wish we had more caterers like Kshuda in the DFW area. ,5,2024-10-29
