## GRAPH QL
i have task to explore GraphQL we call it DRIFT APIs,
Ask is for API, pass some parameter conditionally , and also get result with some limited columns ,

can you walk to me all details about GraphQL , specifically about what i explain above ?

I have given one url

https://api-s.drift.uat.nam.nsroot.net/index.html

it hs 2 section, or 2 pans, left pan you enter query in JSON and there is RUN button were to can run query and response you can see in right.

example query is:
{
    changeRequests(filter: {
        number: {requests: "CHG0000025432"}
        {id: {equals: "177398"}}
    })
    {
        id
        number
        description
        active
    }
}


all possible columns are 

tags,
type,
startDate
endDate
timeWorked
risk
reason 
etc

explain me how i can make filter more complex ? and how i can see all fields in response, and then somefields in response ? can i see fields conditionally ? based on value pass in "query" ?
